Screen numbers start at 0. An index of -1 will give you the default screen.

Lets say you have 2 hd monitors side by side.
There are 3 different rectangles returned by different QDesktopWidget methods:

    screen(index)->rect() will give you a rectangle (0,0,1920x1080) on both indices
    screenGeometry(index) will give you (0,0,1920x1080) on first and (1920,0,1920x1080) on the second
    availableGeometry(index) is the actual usable space on the screen, so for example on Windows the space without the taskbar and any pinned sidebars. On mac I suppose this would be the space without the top app bar(whatever you hipsters call it :) ), so this will be something like (0,40,1920x1040) and (1920,40,1920x1040) depending on the size and placement of bars.

So to move a window to another screen you pick the screen you want it on, get its available geometry and use move with a point inside that rectangle.
You can figure out which monitor is to the left, bottom etc. from the default one by analyzing these rectangles.



I use this code for the second display in full screen successfully on both Windows & Linux

QRect screenres = QApplication::desktop()->screenGeometry(1/*screenNumber*/);
SecondDisplay secondDisplay = new SecondDisplay(); // Use your QWidget
secondDisplay->move(QPoint(screenres.x(), screenres.y()));
secondDisplay->resize(screenres.width(), screenres.height());
secondDisplay->showFullScreen();
